=============================
Kairos DB Java Client Library
=============================

We have created a simple library to push metrics and query data points from Java.


The library is a separate open source project called `KariosDB Client <https://github.com/kairosdb/kairosdb-client>`_.

The javadocs are available `here <http://kairosdb.github.io/client/index.html>`_.
